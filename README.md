Carbon_emission
**Objective:**
Develop a data-driven model to predict carbon emissions based on historical and environmental factors, helping policymakers and organizations make informed decisions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

**Key Steps:**
**Data Collection:**
Gather datasets on CO₂ emissions, energy consumption, industrial activity, transportation, and other contributing factors.
Example sources: Climate Change Data (World Bank, IEA), government reports, satellite data.
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies (e.g., filtering out non-numeric entries like SCALE = "Text").
Normalize/standardize data for machine learning models.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Identify trends, correlations, and key emission drivers.
Visualize using heatmaps, time-series plots, and geographical maps.
**Feature Selection & Engineering:**
Select relevant predictors (e.g., GDP, population, fossil fuel usage).
Create new features (e.g., per-capita emissions, emission growth rate).
**Model Development:**
Train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM (for time-series data).
Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, R².
**Insights & Policy Recommendations:**
Identify high-emission sectors.
Suggest mitigation strategies (e.g., renewable energy adoption, carbon taxes).
**Tools Used:**
1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
2.Data Sources: Excel/CSV files, APIs (e.g., World Bank), satellite data.
